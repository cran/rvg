[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/davidgohel/rvg.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davidgohel/rvg) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/davidgohel/rvg?branch=master)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/davidgohel/rvg/branch/master) [![version](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/rvg)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rvg) ![cranlogs](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org./badges/rvg) ![Active](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)

`rvg` is a set of graphics devices that produces Vector Graphics outputs. This package is providing:

-   SVG (*Scalable Vector Graphics*) with `dsvg`. The graphic can be made interactive (tooltip, onclick and id attribute manipulation). To make that work in an HTML document, check for dependencies `d3.js` in the document. This is the svg device used by package [ggiraph](https://davidgohel.github.io/ggiraph).
-   DrawingML for Microsoft PowerPoint with `dml_pptx` and for Microsoft Excel with `dml_xlsx`. Theses formats let users edit the graphic elements (*editable graphics*) within PowerPoint or Excel and have a very good rendering.

These raw XML outputs cannot be used *as is*. Functions `ph_with_vg()` and `ph_with_vg_at()` can be used with package `officer` to add vector graphics in PowerPoint documents.

``` r
library(rvg)
library(ggplot2)
library(officer)

doc <- read_pptx()
doc <- add_slide(doc, layout = "Title and Content", master = "Office Theme")
doc <- ph_with_vg(doc, code = barplot(1:10), type = "body")
print(doc, target = "my_plot.pptx")
```

Function `xl_add_vg()` is the equivalent for Excel workbooks.

``` r
doc <- read_xlsx()
doc <- xl_add_vg(doc, sheet = "Feuil1", code = print(gg), 
  width = 6, height = 6, left = 1, top = 2 )
print(doc, target = "vg.xlsx")
```

By default, theses graphics are *editable*, element edition can be disabled with option `editable = FALSE`. For more details, read officer article [graphics](https://davidgohel.github.io/officer/articles/offcran/graphics.html).
